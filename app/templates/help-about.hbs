	<h2>About</h2>
	<p>This system was developed to assist content providers with varied technical knowledge when producing site content. Content types are broken down into relevant sections to allow for correct content selection and specific implementation advice. The information provided on this site is summarised from Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.1, This is a legal standard that all public bodies must conform to (up to level AA). Below each summarisation good and bad practice examples or information is provided to further assist in your own accessible content implementations. Any connected WCAG Criteria are also linked, these links provide more information on specific guidelines, however may not be as understandable to individuals with a lesser technical knowledge.</p>

	<h3>Finding what you need</h3>
	<p>To find your relevant section, first ask yourself what category your content fits into best out of those displayed on the home screen. Once you have found this, select this section. The page you are taken to will show a breakdown of more specific content elements or areas of implementations, out of the options provided select the one which suits your need. This will bring up an information window with the relevant assistance.</p>
	<br>
	<h3>Understanding Accessibility Sections</h3>
	<p>These sections have four key components, General assistance and information, good practice, bad practice, and relevant WCAG guidelines. General assistance and information provide an overview of the section and what is required of content under this heading. Good and Bad practice sections will show either examples of the relevant content type in accessible and inaccessible ways and an accompanying description, or a explanation of what must be done and avoided to avoid the implementation of inaccessibility. The WCAG reference is a list of links to official accessibility guidelines, these guidelines may not be understandable to all individuals but could provide more information about what must be done to ensure content is implemented in an accessible way. </p>

	<h3>Ensuring your content is Accessible</h3>
	<p>Even by taking heed of the information this system provides it is understandable you may still be unsure of your contents accessibility. Possible actions currently are to ask another individual (possibly a colleague or individual with relevant technical knowledge in the field of accessibility) to check your content with the help of this site. Other possible ways may include online tools such as web accessibility checkers. These can come in many forms, usually these tools will scan through a website and show any accessibility issues generated by your content. Your content can then be altered accordingly.</p>

	<h3>What is Accessibility?</h3>
	<p>Web Accessibility is very important in the modern world. The internet has become a widely used resource that more and more content is added to every day on the sites of both public and private bodies. This progression towards web-based content is due to reasons such as convenience and cost. It is therefore easy in these situations for accessibility to be overlooked. I believe one of the reasons for this widespread lack of web accessibility is a result of a lack of understanding of the importance of accessibility, and how it can be correctly implemented by the web content providers.</p>
	<br>
	<p>Materials available to provide these accessibility guidelines frequently contain complex wording and can cause misunderstanding or confusion in individuals with little to no technical knowledge. Due to this lack of understanding, accessibility issues arise frequently and can lead to sites being unintentionally in breach of the law. This will mainly occur in situations of separation between webpage developer and webpage content provider where although the technically minded web developer is aware of accessibility implementation techniques, this is not passed onto the web content providers in an understandable way.</p>
	<br>
	<p>Accessibility isnâ€™t just a term that refers to the assistance of those with disabilities. It refers to all people and ensures all users can use all webpages and receive the same content and information on a page. For this reason, its therefore so important that accessibility is implemented to cater for as larger group of people as possible. The widespread lack of understanding of accessibility and its implementation needs to be eradicated for this to occur, and the only way to do that is by making information regarding accessibility as accessible and understandable as possible.</p>
